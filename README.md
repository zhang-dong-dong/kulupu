Proof-of-work blockchain built on
[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate).

## Overview

Kulupu is a sister project related to [Solri](https://solri.org). Kulupu's goal
is to create a working proof-of-work blockchain built using unmodified Substrate
blockchain framework. Compared with Solri, Kulupu aims to take a more practical
approach of an on-chain governed self-updating blockchain, while Solri maintains
the ideal minimalist blockchain design.

The consensus engine for Kulupu is the CPU mining algorithm RandomX. For initial
launch, the emission rate is fixed at one coin per second. This, however can be
changed using hard fork or on-chain governance in the future.

## Network Launch

The network has launched, with the first hard fork, code-named **Slag Ravine**,
happeneing at block 100,000. Please ensure you have updated your nodes to
v0.2.0.

Substrate contains a variety of features including smart contracts and
democracy. However, for current version of Kulupu, we only enabled basic balance
and transfer module. This is to keep the network focused, and reduce risks in
terms of stability and safety. Also note that initially the democracy module is
also disabled, meaning we'll be updating runtime via hard fork until that part
is enabled.

## Prerequisites

Clone this repo and update the submodules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kulupu/kulupu
cd kulupu
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install Rust:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Install required tools:

```bash
./scripts/init.sh
```

## Run

### Full Node

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Mining

Install `subkey`:

```bash
cargo install --force --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate subkey
```

Generate an account to use as the target for mining:

```bash
subkey --sr25519 --network=16 generate
```

Remember the public key, and pass it to node for mining. For example:

```
cargo run --release -- --validator --author 0x7e946b7dd192307b4538d664ead95474062ac3738e04b5f3084998b76bc5122d
```

## Proof of Work Parameters

* **Algorithm**: RandomX
* **Block time**: 60 seconds
* **Issurance**: 1 KULU per second (60 KULU per block)
* No premine
